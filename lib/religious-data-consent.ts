 * Explicit consent for religious data during onboarding.

 * A person's tradition (and the birth details that follow it: date of birth, nakshatra, rashi, gotra)
 * is religious and personal information. Before this existed, tapping a tradition saved it to the account
 * straight away and the consent column (`profiles.consent_religious_data`, default false) was never asked
 * for, so the server held a tradition for people who had never agreed and then ignored it everywhere it
 * personalises. Now:
 *   - choosing a tradition shows a switch that is OFF until the person turns it on;
 *   - nothing about the tradition is written to the account until it is on;
 *   - the way to say no is the "Universal / Exploring" choice, which stores no tradition at all;
 *   - the choice is saved in the same row, with `consent_updated_at`, and can be changed in Settings.
 *
 * Everything here is pure so the rules can be tested without a screen.
